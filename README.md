##TODO:

### Survey
- [ ] Add individual survey page
- [ ] Link survey to location
- [ ] Add FileField to Survey form
- [ ] Add ability to save photos to harddrive
- [ ] Add work creation site
- [ ] Add surveys to index page
- [ ] Add save to localStorage (JS) feature to survey
- [ ] Add Customer - Instalation switching animation to survey page
- [ ] Add filtering of locations

### Account / Users
- [ ] Add email authentication to new users
- [ ] Highlight the nav user account so it's more noticeable (not clear it's clicable)
- [ ] Send sign up link on new user creation rather than entering password for user

### Chargers
- [ ] Tidy up the view chargers page formatting. Transposing the table for readability?

### General
- [ ] Update styling on all forms (submit button and fieldsets)
- [ ] User permissions
- [ ] Set up db check so you can initialize the app the first time. Currently it crashes on imports if no DB exists
