Generic single-database configuration.

For SQLite Batch alter operations you need to use 
```
op.batch_alter_table('TABLENAME') as batch_op:
    batch_op.OPERATION(COLUMN INFO)
```
where TABLENAME is the table name that is being changed, OPERATION is the add/drop/alter operation and COLUMN INFO
is the actual column information (db.Column or altered column name etc).
